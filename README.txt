JFC Professional Website (Demo)
===============================

Contents:
- index.html
- css/style.css
- js/script.js
- images/ (SVG placeholders included)

Notes:
1. This is a ready-to-use professional responsive static website designed for demo and lightweight deployment.
2. All images included are SVG placeholders (in images/). Replace them with real photos:
   - Use high-quality photos from Unsplash/Pexels/your own assets.
   - If you prefer remote images, edit index.html references to point to the image URLs.
3. Deployment:
   - Push the folder to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages OR
   - Drag the ZIP contents into Netlify (drag & drop) OR
   - Deploy on Vercel.
4. Map:
   - The Google Maps iframe is included (no API key). Replace the 'q=New%20York' query with your address.
5. Forms:
   - Contact/newsletter forms are demo-only (client-side alerts). To receive messages, integrate:
     - Formspree, Netlify Forms, or Firebase.
6. Live tracking for delivery requires a backend and mapping APIs (Firebase + Google Maps / OpenStreetMap + Leaflet).
7. To customize branding:
   - Edit CSS variables at the top of css/style.css.

Enjoy! â€” If you want, I can:
- Replace SVG placeholders with real Unsplash images inline.
- Add Netlify Forms or Firebase integration.
- Generate a ready-to-deploy GitHub repo.
